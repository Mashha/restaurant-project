# Restaurant project

## Introduction

This has been one of the most interesting project, due to the fact that i used webpack for the first time. At first i felt like webpack makes everything harder, but it does not, after a day or two i already liked it.

So this project is basically made with javascript, and the styles are added with css. I have made an option, where navigation links don't open up in a new tab, but in the same one.

I have made the design first in figma and then implemented it in css. I made png images in canva, figma and the menu that you can download as a pdf when you click on the button on home page. I also made that logo myself in figma. 

I enjoyed every part of it, adding the google map, menu and styling the links and button.
The page is also responsive.
